      <h1>Speaker List for Broward County</h1>
      <p>In a relatively young tech scene like South Florida it's important to create an environment where tech professionals can network, learn and share knowledge. That's why Code for Fort Lauderdale is putting together this list of individuals interested in speaking at local tech events.</p>
      <p>To add your name to the list either fork the GitHub repository or contact Code for Fort Lauderdale. And don't be shy - we're interested in hearing what you have to say whether you're a seasoned pro or are still new to the tech community.</p>
      <p>We'd like to thank <a href="http://wespeaktoo.org/">We Speak Too</a> for the inspiration to start this list. If you can think of any ways to improve the list, we'd love to hear your suggestions.</p>
